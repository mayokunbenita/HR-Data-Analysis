## Key Insihgts
---

-We had a total number of **1470** initial employees and currently left with **1223**.  It shows **16%** in the attrition rate with a total number of **237** exiting the organisation.

-Over **50%** of the employees in the R&D Department left the organisation totalling **133** out of which **88** of the were from Life Sciences.  
High turnover under certain leaders may indicate a need for management training or adjustment in leadership styles.

-Increase in attrition rate will lead to increase in training cost of new employees and reduction in organisational profit.

-A good number of those that left were  **Male** and accounted for about **63%** of the total number of attrition precisely **150** of them.
This could be due to balancing family responsibilities

-More employees between the age brackect of **25-34** exited the organisation with a total of **112**  employees.
This early attrition points to the fact that there could be job role mismatch issue while unboarding or limited career advancement opportunities.

-Based on the data given, majority of the current employee falls within the age bracket of **35-44, 25-34, and 45-54** respectively.  
This emphasises that the average age of the organisation employee is still less than **40**, which signifies that employees are quite young and in their active years.

-**64%** of the employee that left either **studied Life Sciences or Medicine**, with a total of **89 and 63** employees respectively.
Employeee with specialized skills as these are in high demand and compensation may not be competitive. 

-Among the count of Attrition of **237, 125** of them were still satisfied with their jobs, which infere that they had other reasons for leaving the organisation.


## Recommendations:
